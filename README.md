# Automation-of-YSIR-Reporting
YSIR - Data copied from 5 different text files needs to be filtered with specified information using excel and then update the reports with resulting data.

**Problem Statement**
Your statement is ready - YSIR is reconciliation of daily batch email monitoring. These reports log the count of emails and letters that are sent to the customers and are updated daily when text files are generated by third-party Cheetah team.
These reports have high visibility, anything above the defined variance needs to be alerted to the management team through daily status reporting.

**Proposed Solution**
Since this was daily-recurring process and requires accuracy in updating numeric values, automation was considered a necessity using Excel VBA. By automating, user just needs to update the date for which report needs to be updated and name of the text files into the macro's input sheet and run it. The automation script then accesses all the text files and updates the report with required data.

**Solution Benefits**
There is demonstrable 75% Reduction in time consumed to update the report.
Reduction in manual efforts & elimination of manual errors while updating numeric values.
No Resource dependency.
